Vanity
======
Vanity is a personal microblogging/personal vanity page built on Node.js and Express.

Why Vanity?
-----------
I want my personal website to tell the world who I am and what I'm up to, without too much hand-holding. I want it to play nicely with my social networking accounts in a way that pushes content to the networks, and the people on those networks, that will be interested in my content. Most importantly, I want it to be easy to post quality content on my Vanity page and start conversations across networks (for me that means Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn). I want it to show off the cool stuff I do on Github and any good articles I find.

I want it to be lightweight, minimalistic and dead-simple to use. And I want it on Node.

Contributing
------------
Fork the GitHub project. I recommend hosting your Vanity project on DotCloud. Feel free to contact me (joshisgross.com) or send me pull requests on GitHub.

Database Conventions
--------------------
Database related fields and metadata should have a key prefixed with "d:". Cached data that is strictly temporary should be prefixed with "c:". All other app data should be prefixed with "a:".
